    ///
    /// tldr:
    /// co's are signed objects that define an async order
    /// and several conditions that must be met for the order to be executed.
    ///
    /// deep dive:
    /// co's are composed of 8 main parts:
    /// 1. The async order details which are defined in the OrderDetails struct
    ///    (the order that is being submitted to Synthetix perps v3 market)
    /// 2. isReduceOnly flag which indicates if the order can *only* reduce
    ///    the position size and is also defined in the OrderDetails struct
    /// 3. The signer of the co which must be the account owner or delegate
    ///    and is included in the ConditionalOrder struct.
    ///    THIS DATA IS ALWAYS CHECKED ON-CHAIN
    /// 4. The nonce of the co which is included in the ConditionalOrder struct.
    ///    The nonce is specific to the account id and is used to prevent replay attacks.
    ///    The nonce is not specific to an address, but rather an account id.
    ///    THIS DATA IS ALWAYS CHECKED ON-CHAIN
    /// 5. The requireVerified flag which is included in the ConditionalOrder struct.
    ///    If requireVerified is true, all conditions defined in the co must be satisfied *on-chain*
    ///    at the time of execution.
    ///    If requireVerified is false, the co can ONLY be executed by the trustedExecutor and the conditions
    ///    array is effectively unused (in the on-chain context).
    ///    Notice that the conditions are not checked on-chain if requireVerified is false but are
    ///    expected to be checked off-chain by the trustedExecutor. This saves a significant amount gas
    ///    and allows the trusted executor to employ additional sophisticated methods of ensuring
    ///    best trade execution.
    /// 6. The trustedExecutor address which is included in the ConditionalOrder struct.
    ///    The trustedExecutor is the address that can execute the co if requireVerified is false.
    ///    If requireVerified is true, the trustedExecutor is ignored/not used and
    ///    the conditions array becomes the source of verification imposed on-chain.
    /// 7. The maxExecutorFee which is included in the ConditionalOrder struct.
    ///    The maxExecutorFee is the maximum fee that can be imposed by the address that
    ///    successfully executes the co (trustedExecutor or not). This max fee is denominated in $sUSD and is
    ///    enforced on-chain. If the maxExecutorFee is greater than the fee specified
    ///    by the executor, the co will *not* be executed.
    /// 8. The conditions which are included in the ConditionalOrder struct.
    ///    Conditions are encoded function selectors and parameters that are used to determine
    ///    if the co can be executed. Conditions are checked on-chain if requireVerified is true.
    ///    If requireVerified is false, conditions are expected to be checked off-chain by the trustedExecutor.
    ///    Conditions are stictly limited selectors defined in the Engine contract
    ///    (ex: isTimestampBeforeSelector, isPriceAboveSelector, etc.)
    ///
    ///
    /// co's are not created on-chain. They are composed
    /// and signed off-chain. The signature
    /// is then passed to the Engine contract along with the co.
    /// The Engine contract then
    /// verifies the signature along with many other "things"
    /// to determine if the co can be executed.
    ///
    /// Checklist:
    /// In *every* case of co execution, the logic of validating the co is:
    ///
    /// 1. Check if the fee specified by the executor is
    ///    less than or equal to the maxExecutorFee
    /// 2. Check if the account has sufficient $sUSD credit to pay the fee
    ///    (see CREDIT MANAGEMENT for how that can be accomplished)
    /// 3. Check if the nonce has been used
    ///    (see NONCE MANAGEMENT for how that can be accomplished)
    /// 4. Check if the signer is the owner or delegate of the account
    /// 5. Check if the signature is valid for the given co and signer
    /// 6. IF requireVerified is true, check if all conditions are met
    ///    ELSE IF requireVerified is false, check if the
    ///    msg.sender is the trustedExecutor
    ///
    /// All of these checks are carried out via a call to
    /// the Engine's canExecute function
    /// that returns true or false. If canExecute returns true,
    /// the co can be executed assuming the context of
    /// the check(s) is/are reliable.
    /// If canExecute returns false, the co cannot be executed.
    /// This function is expected to be used off-chain to determine
    /// if the co can be executed.
    /// It will be called within the Engine's execute function
    /// to determine if the co can be executed
    /// and if it returns true, the co will be executed.
    /// If it returns false, the co will not be executed
    /// and the transaction will revert with CannotExecuteOrder().
    ///
    /// note: It is recommended to attempt simulating the
    /// co execution prior to submission or employ some other
    /// sophisticated strategy to mitigate the risk of submitting a co that
    /// cannot be executed due to internal Synthetix v3
